## CSS Nontechnical Overview
CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**), a style sheet language for markup (XML, HTML, XHTML). It empowers developers to separate document content from presentation.

CSS was developed because HTML was increasing in popularity and there was limited styling.

CSS can be added in three ways, inline, internal and external CSS. External CSS is most often preferred. In terms of specificity, it goes: inline > internal > external.

### Inline Style Attribute: 
Inline Style Attributes added directly on an HTML element inside of the element's opening HTML tag.

```html
<h2 style="color: #000000; font-size: 2em;"> Hi </h2>
```

|pros|cons|
|---|---|
|Highest specificity: Ensures the style will be applied to the element | Highest specificity: will overwrite most other styles in an internal or external sheet
||Redundant; not DRY
||Cluttered, unreadable HTML markup
||Difficult to manage
||Impossible to style pseudo-elements and classes like **visited**, **hover**, and **active**

**Extra note:** When you change an element's style using JavaScript, it affects the element's inline style and can overwrite existing inline styles permanently.

### Internal: Embedded style tag
Styles for many elements are collected in the **style** tags in the **head** section of an HTML document. This is referred to as an internal style sheet or embedded style tag.

```html
<head>
  <style type="text/css">

   h2 {
     color: #000000;
     font-size: 2em;
   }

   h3 {
     color: #FF69B4;
     font-size: 1em;
   }

  </style>
</head>
```

|pros|cons|
|---|---|
|Cleaner HTML markup than inline styles: all styles are in one section of the document|Loaded with the HTML page and not cached by the browser|
|Selectors apply styles to multiple elements on a page; leading to smaller page size than using all inline styles making it more DRY than inline styles||
|Apply styles to document that are embedded within; not globally||

### External file: linked stylesheet
An external stylesheet is a file dedicated to CSS that is linked in the **head** of an HTML document. This is the most common.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
```

|pros|cons|
|---|---|
|Can be cached by browsers for improved performance|Global: the developer must structure the CSS so that styles are not applied to elements they are not intended for.|
|Global: can be used across pages in your site||

### Terms related to CSS
* UI: (User Interface) How a user interacts with a device or technology. CSS helps a UI design communicate how a user might use a web app.

* Responsive: A web design is responsive if it adjusts to different device screen sizes.
  * Breakpoints: Set in a web page's styles, breakpoints are the markers at which a change will occur to improve the UI.
  * Meta queries: Used for device-specific breakpoints. They include an optional media type and expressions that limit the scope of their contained styles.

    ```css
    @media only screen
    and (min-device-width: 320px)
    and (max-device-width: 480px){
      font-size: 12px;
    }
    ```

* Pixel perfect: Replicating a mockup perfectly (down to the pixel level).
  * Flat design: A minimalist UI design language characterized by simple elements, subtle typography, and flat colors.
  * Skeuomorphism: A design language characterized by elements that look like their counterparts in the real world.
  * Grid system: A simple type of CSS framework that provides column systems for grid layouts, usually helpful for responsive designs.
* W3C: The group responsible for HTML and CSS standards. The largest standards body for Internet design and best practices.

## CSS Selectors & Precedence

### CSS Syntax
Every CSS syntax begins with a selector followed by property: value pairs.

The **values** of the **properties** apply to any HTML elements that match the given **selector**. You can have as many style declarations in a CSS document. 

```css
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: blue;
}
```

### Cascading Styles

```css
p {
    color: black;
}

p span {
    font-weight: bold;
}

p span.highlight {
    color: yellow;
}
```

```html
<p>
  This is some text in a paragraph element. 
  
  <span>
    This text has been styled bold because it is in a span element 
    that's a child of a paragraph element.
   </span>
  
  <span class="highlight">
    This text is yellow because the class selector overrides 
    the tag selector when multiple style declarations apply to the same
    attribute (`color`) of the same element. It's still bold though!
   </span>
</p>
```

### CSS Basic Selectors
* **Element Selector**
  You can directly select HTML elements by stating their name.

  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
  }

* **Descendant Selector**
  Select descendants of elements by using a space between the names of parents and children.

  ```html
  <ul>
    <li><a href="example.com">Style Me!</a></li>
  </ul>
  ```

  ```css
  ul a {
    text-decoration: none; /* This assures the a elements are not underlined */
  }
  ```

* **Child Selector**
  The child selector is exactly like the descendant selector except it can only select the *direct children* of an element. That means if the element is nested too deep then it will not be selected.
  
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li><a href="example.com">Style Me!</a></li>
  </ul>
  ```

  ```css
  ul > a {
    text-decoration: none; /* this does not work */
  }

  ul > li > a {
    text-decoration: none; /* this does work */
  }

* **Class Selector**
  Classes group elements together for styling purposes. Classes are more specific than selecting by an element. Any time you want a group of elements to have the same styling properties, you should give them the same class. Classes are extremely popular in front-end development and are key to making our style code **DRY**. They are also helpful by making our stylesheets more readable.
  
  ```html
  <section>This is a normal section</section>

  <section class="bg-grey">This section has a greyish background</section>

  <header class="bg-grey">This header also has a greyish background</header>
  ```

  ```css
  .bg-grey {
    background-color: whitesmoke;
  }
  ```

* **ID Selectors**
  ID attributes should be unique to their element. Selecting elements by their id can be helpful if an element has unique styling that it won't share with other elements. However, this is often not the case and leads to repetitive styling.

  ```html
  <span id="banana">This span has a banana color</span>
  ```

  ```css
  #banana {
    color: yellow;
  }
  ```

  Try to avoid using ID selectors when you can use class and element selectors!!!

* **Universal Selectors**
  Universal selectors are usually too broad and are rarely necessary. It can be used to change every element on your page.
  ```css
  * {
    border: 1px solid red;
  }

### Overspecificity
If you want to override properties defined for a "specific selector", you need to be more specific than that certain selector. Multiple overrides in your styles can become difficult to manage so, try to be only as specific as necessary do not go overboard.

**!important** is used as the most specific css selector but should never be used unless it is for testing a scenario!!!

```css
header {
    min-width: 500px !important; /* sets the min-width of the header to 500px regardless of any other styling rules */
}
```

### Precedence
Hierarchy of specificity:
  * !important
  * inline styles
  * ID selectors
  * class selectors
  * element selectors
  * universal selector

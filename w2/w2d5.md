## CSS Nontechnical Overview
CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**), a style sheet language for markup (XML, HTML, XHTML). It empowers developers to separate document content from presentation.

CSS was developed because HTML was increasing in popularity and there was limited styling.

CSS can be added in three ways, inline, internal and external CSS. External CSS is most often preferred. In terms of specificity, it goes: inline > internal > external.

* Inline Style Attribute: style attributes added directly on an HTML element inside of the element's opening HTML tag.
```html
<h2 style="color: #000000; font-size: 2em;"> Hi </h2>
```

Inline Style Attribute|
---|---|
pros|cons|
---|---|
Highest specificity: Ensures the style will be applied to the element | Highest specificity: will overwrite most other styles in an internal or external sheet
|Redundant; not DRY
|Cluttered, unreadable HTML markup
|Difficult to manage
|Impossible to style pseudo-elements and classes like **visited**, **hover**, and **active**

**Extra note:** When you change an element's style using JavaScript, it affects the element's inline style and can overwrite existing inline styles permanently.
